## Hopefully a graphing calculator in Electron JS

Clone this repo and open the index.html file in your browser. Exact steps at the bottom.

## Binds

### If something breaks, just use ctrl+r

### Navigation:

  - alt+j: switch to graph
  - alt+s: open function editor while in graph, pressing alt-s again will close and plot all edited functions.
  - enter: calculate arithmetic in the main calculator or plot all graphs in graph mode.
  - `(grave key): clear all graphs.
  - tab: switch function input forward
  - shift-tab: switch function input backward

### Symbols and functions 
  - alt+p: pi
  - CAPITAL e (E): euler's number
  - alt+r: square root
  - alt+i: sin
  - alt+o: cos
  - alt+l: tan

### Misc
  - ctrl+up: navigate to previous input (selected one is highlighted in red, continue going up to select previous result or older results), enter to clear current input and replace with selected previous input/result
  - alt+up: type previous input at current cursor placement


If any calculations aren't possible at this time, either because of a bug or it's a silly thing to calculate, nothing will happen.

## Cloning and opening

```
git clone https://github.com/shrubfromtomorrow/SeniorProject
```
The index.html file will be in SeniorProject/src/index/html
Clicking it should run it in your broswer but you can direct your browser to the file by typing it out manually as well. The exact path will vary.
